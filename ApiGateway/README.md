<h1>NGINX</h1>

1. Role of NGINX

    - Reverse Proxy: NGINX is often used as a reverse proxy server that can handle requests coming from clients and forward them to the appropriate backend services (in our case, Django applications). This setup can help improve response times, manage load, and provide a single entry point for our APIs.

    - Load Balancing: NGINX can distribute incoming traffic across multiple backend servers, which can be beneficial if we're scaling our services or need to manage high traffic. SSL Termination: NGINX can handle HTTPS connections, which offloads the SSL processing from our backend applications, allowing them to focus on serving requests.

2. Complementary Architecture

    - Microservices: If we're implementing a microservices architecture, using NGINX as an API gateway to route requests to different Django services aligns with best practices. Each service can be developed independently and scaled as needed.
    - Separation of Concerns: By using NGINX, we're effectively separating concerns in our application. The backend logic remains in Django, while NGINX takes care of request handling and traffic management.

3. Project Requirements

    - If our project specifically outlines that we need to implement the backend using Django without any intermediary, then using NGINX in a way that violates those requirements could be seen as not adhering to the project guidelines. However, if the project allows or encourages or does't explicitly say that we can not use additional tools for architecture improvement, then our approach is valid.

4. Clarifying Expectations

    - Explain Your Choices: When you present your project, be prepared to explain why you chose to implement NGINX, detailing its benefits and how it complements your Django backend.

<h2> Conclusion </h2> <br>

Using NGINX as part of our architecture can greatly enhance our project's functionality and performance. Just we have to ensure that we stay aligned with the project's requirements and be ready to articulate the rationale behind our architectural decisions. If done correctly, it demonstrates our understanding of real-world application design, which is a valuable skill in software development.
